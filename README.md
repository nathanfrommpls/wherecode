# Where is your code?
Like many professionals in the industry the code that I write in my $dayjob resides in private repositories that I cannot share publically. As a result the code in this github profile has mostly contained quickly-abandoned concepts.

My hope is that throughout Northern Hemisphere Winter 2024-2025 that I can clean up and populate this github with a modest amount of code related to but seperate from my professional work as a ["DevOps Engineer"](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/counterintuitive-takeaways-devopsdays) and System Administrator.
